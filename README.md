# WORKSPACE

-This project was inspired from doing my work during that time I was traveling. I needed to get some work done online at the time but I did not realize that in the area I was in, most of coffee shop did not have wifi. I remembered walked for about thrity minute before I found a cafe with free wifi.

-This application is simple. It helps you find quick places that you can sit down and do your work based on the zipcode you enter. It returns the top 5 business rating on yelp with 'free wifi' and 'good for work'. The result for each business includes, Business name, yelp rating with link, business categories, address, link to google map for the business and google map street view of the business.

Side note: I, first, named this app 'Alice'. Alice is the name that I want to give my daughter if I ever have one. Since this is my first web application I ever made, it does hold special place in me. However as the application progressed, I changed to 'workspace' to fit with the application function.
